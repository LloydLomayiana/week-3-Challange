## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm install -g json-server
```


## Appendix

Firstly what I did was went to the assignment and forked it, which took me too Github.
At Github I created a new repository and copied the its code.
After I got the code I went into terminal and run the command "git clone" and added the code i coppied from the repository.
I then downloaded the db.json file and andded it to my week 3 challange folder.
I went back to terminal and run the command and run the command "npm install -g json-server"
I then ran the command "cde ." to open up VScode to start writting code.
In VScode I added a couple new files E.g: index.js, index.html and style.css to the folder.
